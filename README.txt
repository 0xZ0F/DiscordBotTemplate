How To:
-
FIRST:

You need to have Node and NPM (Node package manager) installed. - (Links Below)

After that, you need to initialize npm by opening a terminal/command-promt and type "npm init".

After that, you need to install the Discord api by typing "npm install discord.js --save" in a terminal/command-promt.

Now what you need to do is create a Discord bot on the Discord developers website (link below) and put it's token in config.json.

After Setup:

To start the bot, open a terminal/command-promt in the folder with this bot. Then run this command: "node bot.js"
